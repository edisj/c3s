    """Divide `n_frames` into `n_blocks` balanced blocks.
    The blocks are generated in such a way that they contain equal numbers of
    frames when possible, but there are also no empty blocks.
    Arguments
    ---------
    n_frames : int
        number of frames in the trajectory (â‰¥0). This must be the
        number of frames *after* the trajectory has been sliced,
        i.e. ``len(u.trajectory[start:stop:step])``. If any of
        `start`, `stop, and `step` are not the defaults (left empty or
        set to ``None``) they must be provided as parameters.
    n_blocks : int
        number of blocks (>0 and <n_frames)
    start : int or None
        The first index of the trajectory (default is ``None``, which
        is interpreted as "first frame", i.e., 0).
    stop : int or None
        The index of the last frame + 1 (default is ``None``, which is
        interpreted as "up to and including the last frame".
    step : int or None
        Step size by which the trajectory is sliced; the default is
        ``None`` which corresponds to ``step=1``.
    Returns
    -------
    slices : list of slice
        List of length ``n_blocks`` with one :class:`slice`
        for each block.
        If `n_frames` = 0 then an empty list ``[]`` is returned.
